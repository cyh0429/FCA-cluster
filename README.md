# FCA-cluster

This study visualized the results using the ClusterGVis package in R (Zhang 2022), with clustering performed based on the package of Mfuzz (Kumar and Futschik 2007), and the package of stats, specifically the kmeans function. The number of clusters was determined using the Elbow method, implemented using the getclusters package.

This study data includes the raw data and the code of clustering visualization of FCA and KMA method.

The optimal number of clusters is calculated via the elbow method. In this study, the number of clusters c was determined to be 4.
